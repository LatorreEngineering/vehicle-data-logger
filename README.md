# 🚗 Vehicle Data Logger for EB corbos Linux

A lightweight vehicle data logger that collects **OBD-II/CAN bus** diagnostics and stores them for analysis.  

## 🔥 Features
- 📊 Logs **vehicle speed, RPM, fuel level, and more**.
- 📂 Saves data in **CSV or JSON format**.
- 📡 Optionally, send logs **to a remote server** for further analysis.
- 🖥️ Supports **real-time visualization** (future feature).

## **3. Initial Code (`src/logger.py`)**  

Here’s a basic Python script to log **OBD-II data** using the `pyOBD` library:  

```python
import obd
import csv
import time

# Connect to OBD-II
connection = obd.OBD()

# Parameters to log
commands = [obd.commands.SPEED, obd.commands.RPM, obd.commands.FUEL_LEVEL]

# Open CSV file
with open("logs/vehicle_log.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Timestamp", "Speed (km/h)", "RPM", "Fuel Level (%)"])

    while True:
        timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        row = [timestamp]

        for cmd in commands:
            response = connection.query(cmd)
            row.append(response.value.magnitude if response.value else "N/A")

        writer.writerow(row)
        print(row)
        time.sleep(1)  # Log every second

## **Next Steps**  
- Add **real-time visualization** using **Matplotlib or Flask**.  
- Support **CAN bus** logging.  
- Enable **remote logging** (send data to a cloud database).  

Would you like help adding real-time visualization or cloud integration? 🚀
